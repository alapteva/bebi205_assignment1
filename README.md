# bebi205_assignment1
My code for BE/Bi 205 Assignment 1.

We are asked to create a function that accepts an X and y, preprocesses the data, passes it through our model, and returns a dictionary mapping segmentation IDs to celltype codes. The function that achieves this is generate_dict(X, y), found at the bottom of the code. This function returns a dictionary that maps the cell label number to the celltype numerical code.
